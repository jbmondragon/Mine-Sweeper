# Mine Sweeper Game
## Developed by Jake Benusa Mondragon

**Mine Sweeper** is a classic logic puzzle game. It features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden *mines* randomly placed throughout the board.

The objective is to clear the entire board without *detonating* any mines. Clues are provided by numbers indicating how many neighboring tiles contain mines.
