  <h1>Mine Sweeper Game</h1>
  <h2>Developed by Jake Benusa Mondragon</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Mine Sweeper</strong> is a classic logic puzzle game. It features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden 
    <em>mines</em> randomly placed throughout the board. The objective is to clear the entire board without 
    <em>detonating</em> any mines. Clues are provided by numbers indicating how many neighboring tiles contain mines.
